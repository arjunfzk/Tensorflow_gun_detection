# Tensorflow_smart_surveillance_gun_detection
A prototypewhere we use tensorflow and YOLO to detect weapons, covered faces and anomalies to cctv cameras smarter. Whenever the footage has a gun in it, the concerned authorities get an alert for which we are using skype using selenium.We will also add support to notify via telegram and WhatsApp. The model weights are large in size and not included in the repository as we are still tinkering with the model to avoid false positives and negatives and achieve a greater accuracy.
(also as it is a working prototype, we trained one model and tested it in all the scenarios but for production level we can have different models for Atms,banks, public transport stations as that will give us a huge boost in accuracy)
